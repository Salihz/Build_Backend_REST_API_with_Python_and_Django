### [URL dispatcher](https://github.com/ikostan/Build_Backend_REST_API_with_Python_and_Django/blob/master/app/app/urls.py)

A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application. Django lets you design URLs however you want, with no framework limitations.

### [WSGI](https://github.com/ikostan/Build_Backend_REST_API_with_Python_and_Django/blob/master/app/app/wsgi.py)

Django’s primary deployment platform is WSGI, the Python standard for web servers and applications.

Django’s startproject management command sets up a simple default WSGI configuration for you, which you can tweak as needed for your project, and direct any WSGI-compliant application server to use.

Django includes getting-started documentation for the following WSGI servers:

- How to use Django with Gunicorn
- How to use Django with uWSGI
- How to use Django with Apache and mod_wsgi
- Authenticating against Django’s user database from Apache
