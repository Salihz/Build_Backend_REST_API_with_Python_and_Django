# Testing Django

## Integration Tests

Integration testing combines different pieces of code functionality to make sure they behave correctly.

Verify how groupings of components work when used together. Integration tests are aware of the required interactions between components, but not necessarily of the internal operations of each component. They may cover simple groupings of components through to the whole website.
